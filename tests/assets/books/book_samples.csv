sample_1,"I recently visited a local bookstore in Portland and had a lovely chat with the owner. We mostly discussed the rise in popularity of Scandinavian crime fiction. I'm still deciding whether to buy a new lamp.\nOne of the most popular authors this month is Alice Munro. Her latest collection, *Fictions of the North*, has been flying off the shelves — 35,000 copies sold in just 2 weeks. Another standout is *Small Kingdoms* by Elisa Wu, priced at $14.99 and rated 4.5 by our in-house reviewers. It's classified as fiction and is now a bestseller.\nMeanwhile, *The Mindful Cook* by David Tran fits squarely in the self-help genre, though sales are slower (around 5,000 copies). Customers gave it a 3.0 rating average. Oh, and I found a great recipe for miso soup that I’m going to try tomorrow."
sample_2,"Sometimes I wonder if I spend too much on books. Then I look at my shelves and smile.\nThis week’s spotlight author is James B. Liao, whose nonfiction bestseller *The Atomic Public* just hit 50,000 sales. It's priced at $22.50, has a 4.8 rating, and is widely praised in academic circles. Another book worth mentioning: *The Forgotten Valley* by Nora Chase. It's fiction, priced at $18, and holds a strong 4.2 rating. Both are still in stock.\nAlso worth noting: *Becoming Visible* by Talia Rami (biography, 4.6 rating) recently won a local book prize. I picked up a new candle and a fake plant from the store too."

Grier, 5-star ratings from all 8 reviewers, $16.75\n2. *Built to Breathe* – self-help by Minh Dinh, 3.9 average rating, $12.00, not currently in stock\n3. *The Climate Equation* – nonfiction by Carla Singh, bestseller, 60,000+ copies sold, $19.95\nI also saw a cat sleeping on a chair by the register. Very cozy."

Another good one is *City of Dust* by Mei Zhao — fiction, $17.75, 4.0 rating. Both are still in stock and selling well.\nWe’re also seeing some traction on *Ghosts of Saigon* by Lani Pham — fiction again, 3.8 rating, but fewer sales overall. Not a bestseller yet, but promising."

Another strong performer is *The Colorless Eye* by Marcus Juno, in the “other” category, priced at $13.00, and rated 4.3.\nLess well-known is *Thinking Fast on a Budget* by Clare Mendez — self-help, 3.1 rating, $10.00, not currently available."
